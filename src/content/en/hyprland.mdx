One day, I was browsing the internet, and I found a couple news posts about a new window manager called Hyprland.

There is already plenty of posts on Reddit showing off their beautiful desktop that doesn't looks like traditional desktops like Gnome or KDE, which is a thing I've trying to do for years.

After digging through some documentation and videos, I decided to give it a try. I will share how I installed and configured Hyprland on my computer in this post.

Oh btw, here's how it looks like right now:

![My current hyprland desktop](../../assets/blog/hyprland/desktop.png)

## Installation

Installation is very simple, you only need to install bare metal Arch Linux (Without any desktop environment) and run the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland
```

You might also need `kitty` terminal emulator, because Hyprland uses `kitty` as the default terminal emulator. You can install it by running:

```bash
sudo pacman -S kitty
```

Well, isn't that simple? Note that I still recommend to use Arch Linux as the base system, but using Arch based distro like Manjaro or EndeavourOS will work too.

> Note that I don't recommended to use Debian or Fedora, they don't update as fast as Arch Linux does.

> You can still use it if you want to, but some additional components needed by Hyprland or required to make Hyprland better might not exists in their software repositories. You probably need to **compile them by yourself**.

After installing Hyprland, you also need a login manager if you don't want to type `hyprland` under tty everytime you start your PC.
I use `sddm` because it's simple and customizable. You can install it by running:

```bash
sudo pacman -S sddm
```

After a quick reboot, Voilà! You successfully installed Hyprland on your computer.

## Customization

Oh wait, you got a destop that's not even close beautiful? Due to Hyprland ships with a bare minimum, auto generated configuration, you need to configure everything from ground up. For example following key binding are not working by default:

- Brightness control
- Volume control
- Screenshot

Not to mention there is not a lock screen by default, you see what the *hightly customizable* here? Hyprland doesn't configure everything for you out of the box, you need to do everything by yourself.

I first remove the auto generated config warning appeared on the top of the screen:

Open `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`, and comment following line starts with `autogenerated`:

```ini
# #######################################################################################
# AUTOGENERATED HYPR CONFIG.
# PLEASE USE THE CONFIG PROVIDED IN THE GIT REPO /examples/hypr.conf AND EDIT IT,
# OR EDIT THIS ONE ACCORDING TO THE WIKI INSTRUCTIONS.
# #######################################################################################

autogenerated = 1 # remove this line to remove the warning // [!code focus] // [!code --]
# autogenerated = 1 # remove this line to remove the warning // [!code focus]
```

The small warning banner will disappear after you save the file. Hyprland will reload config file as soon as it detects changes in the config file. You can also trigger config reload by typing `hyprctl reload` in the terminal.

Hyprland has it's own config file documentation, you can find all all available options in the [official wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Variables/).

## Adding extra spice to Hyprland

Hyprland doesn't have a lot of features like other window managers or desktop environments out of the box. But you can add extra features to Hyprland by installing additional software.

I will mention several things that I added to my Hyprland setup to make it more usable (Also more beautiful):

### waybar

[waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) is a status bar for Wayland. It can be customized with Waybar's config file and GTK CSS.

![waybar on my desktop](../../assets/blog/hyprland/waybar.png)

To install waybar, you can run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S waybar
```

After installing, you can execute `waybar` in the terminal to start it. You can also add `waybar` to hyprland auto start in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```diff
# Other config ...
+ exec-once = waybar
```

This will start `waybar` automatically when you start Hyprland.

waybar can be customized by editing `~/.config/waybar/config` and `~/.config/waybar/style.css`, you can find more information about Waybar in the [official documentation](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki)

### wlogout

[wlogout](https://github.com/ArtsyMacaw/wlogout) is a logout menu that uses Wayland protocols. It can be used to logout, reboot, shutdown, and lock the screen.

![wlogout screenshot](../../assets/blog/hyprland/wlogout.png)

To install wlogout, you can run:

```bash
paru -S wlogout
```

> `wlogout` is in AUR. You can replace `paru` with `yay` or any other AUR helper you prefer.

wlogout has plenty of options that can be configured in `~/.config/wlogout/layout` and `~/.config/wlogout/style.css`. You can check it out using following man command:

```bash
man 5 wlogout
```

Unlike `waybar` which needs to be started when Hyprland starts, `wlogout` can be bind to a keybind in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```diff
+ bind = SUPER, P, exec, wlogout
```

This will open `wlogout` when pressed `SUPER (Normally Windows key) + P` key combination.

### wofi

> Note that wofi seems not being actively maintained anymore, but it still works fine on my setup. If you mind that, check out some alternatives like [fuzzel](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/fuzzel) or [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)

[wofi](https://sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi/) is a wayland based application launcher / menu. It also supports custom GTK CSS.

![wofi screenshot](../../assets/blog/hyprland/wofi.png)

To install wofi, you can run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S wofi
```

You can start `wofi` by running `wofi` in the terminal. You can also bind `wofi --show drun` to a keybind in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

``` ini
bind = SUPER, D, exec, wofi --show drun
bind = SUPER, D, exec, wofi --show drun
```

> To show application icon in wofi, add `--allow-images` to the command line options.

### SwayOSD

[SwayOSD](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayOSD) is a cool on-screen OSD that will show volume and brightness changes, also optional Caps Lock key and Num Lock key status changes.

To install SwayOSD, you can run:

```bash
paru -S swayosd-git
```

> `swayosd-git` is in AUR. You can replace `paru` with `yay` or any other AUR helper you prefer.

## My dot files

There is a repository on GitLab with some of my dot files, including my Hyprland configuration. You can check it out [here](https://gitlab.com/wolf-yuan/dotfiles).
