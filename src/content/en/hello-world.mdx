So how to print `Hello World!` in console? You can try out this simple code snippet:

```ts
console.log("Hello World!");
```

---

You could also print multiple lines of Hello World using `for` loop. We will discuss `for` loop in future blog posts that won't be written at all.

```ts
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}
```

Here is how it works:

1. First, it runs the `for` loop
2. Second, it works.

It should print `Hello World!` for five times, if it didn't, you can try to fix it by:

- Change
  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)
  ```
  to
  ```js
  for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++)
  ```
