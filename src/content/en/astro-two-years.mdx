A few weeks ago, I saw the news that Cloudflare invested a huge amount of money in Astro, a web framework. That suddenly reminded me that I’ve also been using Astro on my site for a *long* time, so I figured it was a good moment to look back.

I went back to check an old `package.json`. According to [my earliest commit](https://gitlab.com/wolf-yuan/website/-/commit/070fd7c623f942164e8a4597f2af0a60946ce80e), I was using Astro `2.9.6` back then. I looked up the [release date for 2.9.6](https://github.com/withastro/astro/releases/tag/astro%402.9.6), and it was released on 2023/7/29. Doing the math, it’s already been two to three years.

## What Astro has changed

Personally, I feel Astro’s update speed has slowed down a bit now. Still, it’s one of the fastest-moving web frameworks I’ve seen in terms of major versions — from 2.x all the way to 5.x. A lot changed along the way, from new features to improvements on older ones, and Astro has done a really good job in these areas.

### View Transitions API

The most exciting one for me was when Astro added support for the [View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/), which at the time was only available in Chrome. This API makes page-to-page transitions much smoother.

Astro built this feature in directly. I still remember seeing the demo and thinking it was *super-duper* cool. I immediately wrote some code so my own website could use it too.

> The View Transitions API is now supported by more browsers, Firefox users can also see these fancy transitions.

> In Astro, this is now called `<ClientRouter />`.

### i18n routing

In Astro 3.5, they introduced a new feature: [i18n routing](https://astro.build/blog/astro-350/). It made building multilingual websites much easier.

Basically, Astro moved the routing work for multilingual sites into the framework layer, so developers can focus on content and design.

In Astro 4, they improved the i18n routing logic again, adding support for defining a default language and exposing useful variables to help pages detect the current locale.

#### i18n is... a half completed feature?

Even though Astro added i18n, I personally think it only solved half the problem — mainly routing.

If you’re building larger or more complex sites, you may still need tools like [astro-i18n-aut](https://github.com/jlarmstrongiv/astro-i18n-aut) to handle templates. Otherwise, you can end up with a somewhat awkward file structure like this site:

```
src/pages/
├── 404.astro
├── blog
│   ├── index.astro
│   └── [slug].astro
├── index.astro
├── rss
│   ├── blog-en.xml.js
│   └── blog-zh.xml.js
└── zh-tw
    ├── 404.astro
    ├── blog
    │   ├── index.astro
    │   └── [slug].astro
    └── index.astro
```

If you don’t see the issue right away: when I want to update page content, I have to edit both `/src/pages/index.astro` and `/src/pages/zh-tw/index.astro`. That becomes annoying fast when you’re making bigger layout or style changes.

### Amazing template generation

> This isn’t a new feature, but it’s so good that I need to mention it again.

If you’ve used React-like frameworks, you’ve definitely seen syntax like this:

```ts
() => {
  const mySuperTitle = "Hello World";
  
  return (
    <h1>{mySuperTitle}</h1>
  )
}
```

The cool part is Astro supports a very similar style. Think of it as React, but without shipping all that JS:

```astro
---
const mySuperTitle = "Hello World";
---

<h1>{mySuperTitle}</h1>
```

> Quick note: the JavaScript between the two `---` runs on the server. The part below is what gets sent to the client. So if you write a `<script>` tag below, that code runs in the browser — which is very handy for interactive pages.

## I accidentally pulled a lot of people into the Astro rabbit hole

It feels like more and more people are using Astro now. Around me, I’ve seen many people switch. For example, [Elvis Mao](https://elvismao.com) seems to really love Astro and even created a template called [fastro](https://github.com/elvisdragonmao/fastro).

Others have started using Astro too, mostly for blogs:

- [Frank’s frk.tw](https://blog.frk.tw)
- [Ummit’s ummit.dev](https://ummit.dev)

Even some big companies are using it now:

- [The Firebase Blog](https://firebase.blog)
- [IKEA’s official website](https://ikea.com)
- And of course, [Cloudflare’s docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com)

Astro has absolutely given many developers the ability to build websites quickly. Its learning curve is also pretty friendly, which makes it easy for a lot of people to pick up. I hope Astro keeps evolving and polishing its features in the future.
