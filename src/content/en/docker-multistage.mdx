Imagine you finally finished your project, and you want to pack it into a beautiful Docker image. You wrote a `Dockerfile`, ran the `docker build` command, and then you realized the image size is **huge**. It's like 1GB for a simple Node.js application. You start to wonder, "Is there a way to reduce the image size?"
